# Warcraft3-Healing-AI
A simple AI behavior where an allied character heals the player when the player's health falls below a certain threshold.

- WORK IN PROGRESS -
The ultimate aim of the project is to design a healing bot which will assist the player in doing a heavy raid encounter.
Currently the AI character heals the player even though there could be other optimal solutions available.
For e.g. It might be beneficial for the AI to provide the player with immunity pro-actively instead of healing reactively.
Additionally, mana management behavior tree work in progress.
